## Milestone 1 Feedback
Good work here. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are very basic but they get the point across. Regarding your audience, think about the type of professional audience you are looking to market towards. As there are many different sectors in the workforce, really try any pinpoint who you are really looking to work for/with your new skills. The persona is also a little slim in regards to goals and the user story. Both of these things are helpful in shaping the way you want others to view your site. The more detail you provide in the design phase will help further along in your development phasese. These are suggestions to take into consideration as you move forward into Milestone 2a. 

Your milestone 1 passes at a Tier II due to late submission and lack of detail. Code is up to spec and you're approved to move onto Milestone 2a.
